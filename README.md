## Tasks

The whole test is divided in three levels and the collection of answers to these questions is splitted across the different folders as explained on the [Repository Organization](#repository-organization). The following table shows the questions to be answered and for each of them it shows if it was answered and the corresponding link to the answer.

    // Open the file for writing
    outputFile.bufferedWriter().use { writer ->
        repeat(count) {

            writer.write("$randomFloat\n")
        }
    }

    println("Generated $count random floats and saved them to $fileName.")
}

fun main() {
