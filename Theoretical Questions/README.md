# Theoretical Questions

In order to proceed with the interviewing process T-Pro asked a couple of theoretical questions that are splitted by two levels.

## First Level

**1. Explain the main concept of lambda functions.**

 A:Think of lambda expressions as little coding shortcutsâ€”a way to write concise, anonymous functions.

**2. What's the difference between `UInt16` and `Int32`?**

 A:UInt16 (Unsigned 16-bit Integer):
 Represents a 16-bit unsigned integer.
 Range: 0 to 65,535.
 Memory: 2 bytes.
 Example: UInt16[] arr = { 3, 7, 15, 65535 };
 Int32 (Signed 32-bit Integer):
 Represents a 32-bit signed integer.
 Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
 Memory: 4 bytes.
 Example: Int32[] arr = { -3, 0, 1, 3, 7 };

**4. Do you have any experience with functional programming languages?**

 A:No

## Second Level

**1. Do you have experience with C++ (JNI) code in Android projects? If yes describe what you have implemented.**

 A:No
